#In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fₙ, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such 
#that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, and for n > 1. The 
#sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,

#Produce a list of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
#The list should produce the values:
#1 0
#2 1
#3 2
#4 3
#5 5
#6 8
#7 13
#8 21
#9 34
#10 55
$iprevious = 1;
$preprevious = 0;
for ($i=0; $i -lt 10; $i++){
#if i =0, output 0, if i=1 output 1, else output sum of previous two i. There's a need to save the previous two values.
